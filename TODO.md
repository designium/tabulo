# TODO

* Consider incorporating a linter / static analysis tool into the build.
* Raise an ArgumentError for disallowed arguments and options (this is
  a library!)
* Document :formatter option in README.
* Column#initialize should have the same signature as Table#add_column.
* Handle multiline cell content (i.e. when the calculated cell value
  itself contains a newline).
* Pending specs.
